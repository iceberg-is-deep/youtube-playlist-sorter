Playlist Sorter Privacy Policy
</p>

<p>
Playlist Sorter runs in the Chrome browser, and communicates with the YouTube API,
on behalf of the user, to sort videos within a playlist.
</p>

<p>
In order to do this, Playlist Sorter must ask for the user's YouTube login credentials and
transmit them to YouTube. This is done via the standard Google-provided YouTube OAuth user
interface, and is encrypted by HTTPS.
</p>

<p>
Playlist Sorter never stores or transmits the credentials anywhere else. Playlist Sorter has
no server of its own.
</p>

<p>
The App does not store or transmit any user data outside the use of the YouTube API.
